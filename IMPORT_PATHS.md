# Import path reference

This file lists Solidity files under `contracts/` and the relative imports they use, with whether the referenced file exists in the repository and its resolved path.

Generated by an automated scan.

## Summary (selected imports)

- `contracts/orchestrator/Orchestrator.sol`
  - imports `../factory/interfaces/IChunkFactory.sol` -> exists: YES -> `contracts/factory/interfaces/IChunkFactory.sol`
  - imports `../dispatcher/interfaces/IManifestDispatcher.sol` -> exists: YES (file present) -> `contracts/dispatcher/interfaces/IManifestDispatcher.sol`

- `contracts/facets/MaliciousFacet.sol`
  - imports `../dispatcher/interfaces/IManifestDispatcher.sol` -> exists: YES -> `contracts/dispatcher/interfaces/IManifestDispatcher.sol`

- `contracts/dispacher/ManifestDispacher.sol`
  - imports `./interfaces/IManifestDispatcher.sol` -> exists: NO (file missing under `contracts/dispacher/interfaces/`)
  - imports `../interfaces/diamond/IDiamondLoupe.sol` -> exists: YES -> `contracts/interfaces/diamond/IDiamondLoupe.sol`
  - imports `../interfaces/diamond/IDiamondLoupeEx.sol` -> exists: YES -> `contracts/interfaces/diamond/IDiamondLoupeEx.sol`
  - imports `../utils/OrderedMerkle.sol` -> exists: YES -> `contracts/utils/OrderedMerkle.sol`
  - imports `../libraries/RefactorSafetyLib.sol` -> exists: YES -> `contracts/libraries/RefactorSafetyLib.sol`

- Other manifest imports:
  - `contracts/governance/GovernanceOrchestrator.sol` imports `../manifest/ManifestTypes.sol` and `../manifest/ManifestUtils.sol` -> both exist under `contracts/manifest`

Notes:

- The repository contains both `contracts/dispacher/` (misspelled) and `contracts/dispatcher/` (correct) directories; some files import from `../dispatcher/...` while the implementation in `contracts/dispacher/` imports the local `./interfaces/IManifestDispatcher.sol` which is missing. To avoid changing many contracts, consider creating a reference file that records all canonical import locations and/or adding the missing interface file into `contracts/dispacher/interfaces/`.
