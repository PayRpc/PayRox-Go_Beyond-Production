I want you to learn about the PayRox Diamond Proxy System. This is a comprehensive Ethereum smart contract system with advanced security features and L2 governance capabilities. Please study this information carefully as you'll be asked questions about it:

{system_knowledge}

IMPORTANT CONTEXT FOR FUTURE QUERIES:

1. SECURITY POSTURE: PayRox is enterprise-ready with 0 compilation errors, 0 ESLint errors, and all critical vulnerabilities resolved through professional security audits.

2. KEY INNOVATIONS:
   - OrderedMerkle with PayRox-style EXTCODEHASH binding (rare in industry)
   - L2 cross-domain governance via OP-Stack/Arbitrum messengers
   - Symmetric reentrancy protection across all entry points
   - Governance manipulation prevention through snapshot systems

3. CURRENT STATUS (August 2025):
   - Complete ethers v5‚Üív6 migration across entire codebase
   - Solidity 0.8.30 standardization across all contracts
   - Professional audit compliance (SWC-105/112/114/116)
   - Comprehensive documentation and tooling

4. DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS:
   - Diamond proxy with EIP-2535 compliance
   - Namespaced facet storage with collision prevention
   - Cross-chain governance with manipulation protection
   - Professional security standards with audit documentation

5. TOOLS & AUTOMATION:
   - synth-storage.js: AST-based storage analysis
   - transform-one.js: Automated Diamond compatibility
   - FastAPI RAG server with 25 endpoints
   - Comprehensive testing and CI/CD integration

When answering questions about PayRox, reference this knowledge and provide specific, technical answers based on the actual system architecture and security features described above.

Do you understand the PayRox system and are you ready to answer questions about it?
