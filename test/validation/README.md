## 📋 Assessment Categories

The system evaluates readiness across 5 critical categories:

### 🛡️ Security (Critical Priority)
- External security audit completion
- Penetration testing and formal verification
- Code freeze and final security review

### 🏛️ Governance (High Priority)
- Governance procedures documentation and testing
- Multi-signature and access control validation

### 🧪 Testing (Critical Priority)
- Comprehensive testing suite with >95% coverage
- Production environment testing and validation
- Mainnet simulation and final validation

### 📚 Documentation (High Priority)
- Complete documentation and user guides
- Freeze procedures and emergency protocols

### ⚙️ Operations (Medium Priority)
- Monitoring and alerting systems operational
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Performance optimization and gas efficiency

## 🚨 Decision Logic

The system uses intelligent decision-making logic:

- **CRITICAL CONDITIONS:** Must be 100% complete
- **HIGH PRIORITY:** Must be ≥80% complete
- **BLOCKERS:** Any critical condition that's incomplete
- **RISK SCORING:** 0-100 scale with multiple factors
- **CONFIDENCE LEVEL:** Based on validation completeness

## 📊 Output Formats

### Console Output
Human-readable terminal display with progress bars, colored status indicators, and detailed condition breakdown.

### JSON Format
Machine-readable structured data perfect for automation, integration, and dashboard consumption.

### Markdown Reports
Documentation-friendly format ideal for sharing with stakeholders and including in project documentation.

### HTML Dashboard
Interactive web dashboard with real-time updates, charts, and visual progress tracking.

- **No rollback possible once executed**
- **Only emergency pause/unpause remains available**
- **New deployments required for any changes**

### 🛡️ Security Considerations
- Always run assessments in simulation mode first
- Verify all critical conditions before live assessment
- Use proper network configurations
- Ensure secure key management for production

### 📊 Production Readiness
- Run comprehensive tests before deployment
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Configure backup and recovery procedures
- Document emergency response protocols
