   - Added PayRox-style EXTCODEHASH binding for Diamond integrity

2. **GovernanceOrchestrator Security Hardening**
   - Snapshot system preventing quorum manipulation
   - Active proposal protection with _hasActiveProposals()
   - Emergency cancellation capabilities with EMERGENCY_ROLE
   - Governance manipulation protection via snapshotTotalSupply/snapshotQuorumThreshold

3. **ManifestDispatcher Production Security**
   - Freeze bypass prevention in adminRegisterUnsafe
   - Emergency incident response via removeRoutes pause bypass
   - L2 timestamp awareness with L2TimestampWarning events
   - Dev registrar safety toggles for production environments

## Key System Components

### Core Contracts

#### PayRoxProxyRouter.sol
- **Purpose**: L2-ready Diamond proxy router with cross-domain governance
- **L2 Integration**: OP-Stack/Arbitrum messenger compatibility via ICrossDomainMessenger
- **Security Features**: 
  - Dual governance (EOA + L1→L2 cross-domain)
  - Symmetric reentrancy protection
  - Memory allocator bug fixes in _delegateTo
  - Pause-aware receive() function

#### ManifestDispatcher.sol  
- **Purpose**: Core Diamond dispatcher with manifest-based routing
- **Security**: EXTCODEHASH gating prevents same-address code swaps
- **Features**: Freeze bypass prevention, emergency incident response, dev registrar controls

#### GovernanceOrchestrator.sol
- **Purpose**: Manipulation-proof governance system
- **Security**: Snapshot system prevents mid-vote attacks
- **Features**: Emergency cancellation, active proposal detection, transparency functions

#### OrderedMerkle.sol
- **Purpose**: Position-aware Merkle verification for Diamond routing
- **Innovation**: PayRox-style EXTCODEHASH binding (rare in industry)
- **Security**: Strong domain separation, collision prevention, upgrade safety

### Storage Architecture

#### Diamond Storage Pattern
- **Namespaced Storage**: Each facet uses isolated storage slots
- **Collision Prevention**: keccak256-based slot calculation per facet
- **Upgrade Safety**: Append-only storage layout preservation
- **Tools**: synth-storage.js for automated analysis and transform-one.js for implementation

Example storage pattern:
```solidity
library TokenFacetStorage {
    bytes32 internal constant SLOT = keccak256("TokenFacet.storage");
    
    struct Layout {
        mapping(address => uint256) _balances;
        uint256 _totalSupply;
        bool initialized;
    }
    
    function layout() internal pure returns (Layout storage l) {
        bytes32 slot = SLOT;
        assembly { l.slot := slot }
    }
}
```

### L2 Cross-Chain Governance

#### Cross-Domain Integration
- **Supported Chains**: Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, other OP-Stack L2s
- **Governance Flow**: L1 Governor → Cross-Domain Messenger → L2 PayRoxProxyRouter
- **Security**: Dual governance validation (local EOA + cross-domain L1)

#### Implementation Pattern
```solidity
interface ICrossDomainMessenger {
    function xDomainMessageSender() external view returns (address);
}

contract PayRoxProxyRouter {
    ICrossDomainMessenger public l2CrossDomainMessenger;
    address public l1Governor;
    
    modifier onlyGovernor() {
        require(
            msg.sender == governor() || _isL1GovernorViaCrossDomainMessenger(),
            "PayRoxProxyRouter: caller is not the governor"
        );
        _;
    }
}
```
