- Multi-signature wallet for governance
- Monitoring infrastructure
- Backup and recovery procedures

### Security Prerequisites
- Hardware security modules (HSM) for key management
- Multi-party computation (MPC) for sensitive operations
- Code audit completion certificates
- Penetration testing reports

## Pre-deployment Checklist

### ðŸ”’ Security Validation
- [ ] All smart contracts audited by certified auditors
- [ ] Freeze readiness assessment completed at 100%
- [ ] Emergency pause mechanisms tested
- [ ] Multi-signature governance configured
- [ ] Access control policies verified

### ðŸ§ª Testing Validation
- [ ] Full test suite passes (100% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests on testnets completed
- [ ] Gas optimization analysis completed
- [ ] Deterministic deployment verified
- [ ] Cross-chain functionality tested

### ðŸ“‹ Documentation Validation
- [ ] API documentation complete and current
- [ ] Deployment procedures documented
- [ ] Emergency response procedures defined
- [ ] User guides and tutorials available
- [ ] Code documentation up to date

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Set production environment variables
export NETWORK=mainnet
export DEPLOYMENT_KEY=<secure-key>
export ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<api-key>
```

### 2. Contract Deployment
```bash
# Deploy core contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-production.ts --network mainnet

# Verify contracts on Etherscan
npx hardhat verify --network mainnet <contract-address>
```

### 3. Initial Configuration
```bash
# Configure governance parameters
npx hardhat run scripts/configure-governance.ts --network mainnet

# Set up emergency controls
npx hardhat run scripts/setup-emergency-controls.ts --network mainnet
```

### 4. Validation and Testing
```bash
# Run production validation suite
npx hardhat run scripts/validate-production-deployment.ts --network mainnet

# Test emergency procedures
npx hardhat run scripts/test-emergency-procedures.ts --network mainnet
```

## Post-deployment

### Monitoring Setup
- Deploy monitoring dashboards
- Configure alerting for critical events
- Set up automated backup procedures
- Implement health checks

### Security Measures
- Enable multi-signature requirements
- Activate timelock controls
- Configure emergency pause capabilities
- Set up incident response procedures

## Emergency Procedures

### Pause System
```bash
# Emergency pause (requires multi-sig)
npx hardhat run scripts/emergency-pause.ts --network mainnet
```

### Upgrade Process
```bash
# Prepare upgrade (requires governance vote)
npx hardhat run scripts/prepare-upgrade.ts --network mainnet

# Execute upgrade (requires timelock)
npx hardhat run scripts/execute-upgrade.ts --network mainnet
```

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor gas prices and optimize operations
- Review and update security policies
- Conduct regular security assessments
- Update documentation and procedures

### Scheduled Reviews
- Monthly security reviews
- Quarterly governance assessments
- Semi-annual code audits
- Annual disaster recovery testing
