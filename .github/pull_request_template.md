# Security Audit Implementation

## Overview
Implementation of security audit findings for DeterministicChunkFactory and related facets.

## Changes Made

### Security Fixes
- [ ] System integrity gating enforced in all state-changing creators
- [ ] Fee handling unified with consistent push policy
- [ ] Emergency withdraw hardened with proper access controls
- [ ] Idempotent batch parity fixed
- [ ] Transfer guard scaffolding removed (unused)

### Documentation & Testing
- [ ] Runtime invariant checklist added for CI
- [ ] Billing semantics documented
- [ ] Owner() vs ACS roles clarified
- [ ] Hardhat tests added for invariants

## Audit Compliance
- [ ] All re-audit recommendations implemented
- [ ] System integrity check enforced in deployers
- [ ] Fee policy unified (push with fallback withdraw)
- [ ] Emergency flows properly gated and secured

## Testing
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New invariant tests pass (3/3)
- [ ] Compilation successful (70 files)

## Risk Assessment
**Risk Level**: Medium (Security fixes for production factory)
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, invariant validation, backwards compatibility maintained

## Deployment Notes
- No breaking changes to public API
- Fee policy changes are backwards compatible
- Emergency functions require admin + paused state
